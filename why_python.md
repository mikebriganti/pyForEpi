## Why use Python?

Python is a powerful, open-source programming language free for all to use. Python excels at data analysis due to it's expansive ecosystem of libraries (and the communities surrounding them) where thousands of individuals across the globe are pushing boundaries for data wrangling, data analysis, and data visuazliation. 

Python is already widely adopted across many fields, making it easier for epidemiologists to collaborate with professionals in other fields. With the growing importance for epidemiologists to ingregrate various data sources (i.e. real-world data like Electronic health records and insurance claims, environmental data, actigraphy data, digitial health data, genetic data, etc.) Python provides the ability to work with and process these data types seamlesslesy regardless of the input format, file size, or overall data complexity.

## Why are libraries important

Libraries are groups of code that are developed by others that we can utilize for our projects. In this book we will be focusing on the **Polars** library which will make it easier for us to clean up our datasets. In epidemiology research we are often working with messy, unclean datasets that are full of missing values, incorrect values, duplicates, and other general outliers. We can take full advantage of Python's power and leverage libraries like Polars to process and prepare our data with ease. Even if our datasets are massive in size we can work with the data efficiently.

Other libraries can be applied to build predictive models, which is of growing importance in the field of public health to identify emerging trend, assess risk factors, or make predictions among a sample. Python will allow you to leverare cutting-edge methodology in your research.

Python offers much in terms of visualization too, allowing epidemiologists to create highly customziable (and even interactive) plots. As you know, clear and concise visuals are crucial for epidemiology research and Python will enable you to produce any graphic you need.

Finally, Python libraries offer a tremendous amount of tools you can leverage for other data types you might have access to including imaging, biomarker, and actigraphy data. Without python libraries, our jobs would simply be more difficult.

## Why Python over R?

We love R just as much as Python! However, your project and collaborative need can influence your choice of a packaging language. 

Some considerations to help you choose Python:
* Python is a general purpose programming language, typically used for a wider ranges of tasks over R. This makes Python a natural choice to expanding your programming skillset overall.
* Python offers libraries that often have more advanced capabilities over the R equivalent packages, including in domains like web-scraping, imaging analysis, workflow automations, working with web frameworks, working with the cloud, and working with particular databases.
* If working with massive datasets, or diverse data types, Python may offer more flexibility to seamlessly and efficiently work with your data.
* Since Python is used in more fields overall compared to R, depending on where you or your teammates are coming from, you may have more comfort using Python over R.
